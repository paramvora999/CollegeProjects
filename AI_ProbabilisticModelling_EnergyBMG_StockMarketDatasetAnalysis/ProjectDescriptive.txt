Descriptive :
Development of a Probabilistic Modelling Engine for current numbers of local energy businesses, and also testing the effects of creating a RE based, Smart Contract powered consumer markets.
Testing using different Regression mechanisms to determine efficacy and success possibility of a RE Energy Market Business Model (employed by companies such as PowerLedger or BMG Project) on local areas, by twitching parameters of determination based on local numbers, such as available_electricity, average_cost_of_apparatus, technological_availability, system_maintenance.
Self defined parametric analysis using HMM Modelling, and Multivariable Regression for model training from current numbers in Australia and USA, and testing on local numbers in Kolkata.
Loading historical stock quotes from matplotlib package for this example code. Work done with pre-defined data for multiple portfolios.
